# Projects Portfolio â€“ PCB's for Robotics and Embedded Systems

This repository contains all projects I have developed or contributed to during my academic and research work at the university robotics laboratory or in my high school.

Some projects include embedded systems, IoT applications, and drone platforms (e.g., LR250 and LR500 series).  
However, **the PCB designs and source files for the drone projects are not publicly available**, as they were developed within the laboratory under supervision, and **their publication has not been authorized by my advisor**.

If you are an employer, researcher, or institution interested in evaluating my work for **academic, professional, or recruitment purposes**,  
I can **provide temporary access for review upon request**.  
Please contact me directly via email or LinkedIn for authorization.
